          <h2>History of Modern Roller Derby</h2>
          <p>Modern Roller derby got it's start in the early 2000s in Austin, Texas with the Texas Rollergirls.
            <br> Traditional roller derby was played on a banked track but these were expensive and difficult to
            <br>store and assemble and also limited venue options so the flat track set up was created to save time and money.
            <br>The current flat track set up is the most popular version of roller derby today.
            <br> The Early league formed what was known as the United Leagues coalition in 2004 which eventually became known as 
            <br>Womens Flat Track Derby Association(WFTDA)

                <h2>How roller derby is played</h2>
                <p> Roller derby is played on either a flat or banked track. There are 5 members of each team present on the track, 1 Jammer, 1 Pivot and 4 blockers.
                  <br> The Pivot is the leader of the pack and wears a striped helmet cover. The pivot can also become the Jammer if the the Star Cover is legally passed to her by the current jammer.
                  <br> The Jammer is the point scorer and wears a star helmet cover. 
                  <br> The blockers do not wear any helmet covers, their primary job is to prevent the other team's jammer from scoring point while assisting their own jammer.
                  <br> The game is 1 hour and if broken up in to 2 30 minutes periods and each period is broken in to 2 minute jams. 
                  <br>Jams can end before the 2 minutes is up, such as if the lead jammer calls off the jam, but they will ever be longer than the 2 minutes 
                  <br>The first Jammer to legally leave the pack becomes the lead jammer and hold the ability to end the jam whenever she wants.
                  <br> She can lose the this by commiting a penatly or voluntarily removing her helmet cover, in which case the jam will last the complete 2 minutes.
                  <br> The jamer earns a point for each opposing blocker she passes, her hips having passed the hips of the other players.
